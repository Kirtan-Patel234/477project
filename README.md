## Project Summary

This project analyzes the relationship between air quality and respiratory illness trends in Chicago by integrating EPA air pollutant data (PM2.5 and ozone) with City of Chicago emergency department visit records. We investigate whether fluctuations in air quality correlate with respiratory illness rates and explore temporal trends across different seasons and demographic groups.
